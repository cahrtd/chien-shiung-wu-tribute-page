# Tribute Page

A simple HTML/CSS project dedicated to Chien-Shiung Wu.  
Built as part of a web development learning challenge.

## Features
- Responsive layout
- Clean design with basic semantic HTML
- Focus on structure and accessibility

## Notes
This project was built with platform limitations, so it has some flaws Iâ€™m aware of.  
I plan to revisit and improve (or not lol) it as my skills grow.
