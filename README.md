# chien-shiung-wu-tribute-page
Tribute page honoring Chien-Shiung Wu, a pioneering physicist known as the “First Lady of Physics.” This project showcases her life, scientific achievements, and legacy through a clean, responsive webpage built with HTML and CSS.

I did it as part of freeCodeCamp projects for certificate, so i was kinda limited in design. The whole text is generated by AI, since i was more focused on code itself.
