      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Chien-Shiung Wu was born in 1912 in a small town near Shanghai, China. Her father, an advocate for women's education, founded a girls' school where Wu received her early schooling. From a young age, she showed an exceptional curiosity for science and mathematics. 

She later studied physics at National Central University in Nanjing, and in 1936, she traveled alone to the United States to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley — a bold move for a woman at that time. Under the mentorship of Ernest Lawrence, she completed her Ph.D. in physics, specializing in nuclear fission, just as World War II was reshaping the global scientific landscape.

      <h2>Scientific Breakthroughs and Legacy</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info-2" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Wu’s career was marked by both precision and courage. During World War II, she joined the Manhattan Project, where she worked on radiation detection and improved the process of separating uranium isotopes. But her most famous contribution came in the 1950s, when she designed and conducted the landmark experiment that disproved the law of parity conservation in physics. Though her male colleagues received the Nobel Prize for the discovery, Wu’s meticulous work was the foundation of their success. 

Beyond her research, she was a passionate educator and advocate for women in science. Her legacy continues to inspire generations of scientists who believe that truth should never be constrained by tradition or bias.

      <h2>Barriers Broken and Standards Raised</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info-3" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Despite her groundbreaking work, Wu faced persistent gender and racial discrimination throughout her career. In a field dominated by white male physicists, she often found herself overlooked — most notably when her pivotal contribution to the parity experiment was passed over by the Nobel Committee. Still, she never allowed injustice to silence her. Instead, she set even higher standards for scientific integrity, accuracy, and perseverance. Her dedication earned her comparisons to Marie Curie, though Wu’s quiet resistance carved a legacy entirely her own.

Wu also broke barriers outside the lab: she became the first female physics instructor at Princeton University and later the first woman elected president of the American Physical Society. Her achievements served not only science, but also the ongoing movement for gender equality in academia.

      <h2>Honors, Humility, and Final Years</h2>
      <p id="tribute-info-4" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Chien-Shiung Wu was eventually recognized with numerous honors, including the National Medal of Science and the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics. Yet she remained modest throughout her life, often redirecting praise to the collective pursuit of knowledge rather than her individual brilliance.

In her later years, Wu became increasingly vocal about the importance of education, especially for girls. Her message was clear: the potential of a mind should never be limited by a person’s gender, race, or origin. She passed away in 1997, but her story endures — a testament to the unshakable force of intellect guided by principle.
